# StarShard Scavengers

### A game made for [WASM-4 Jam #2](https://itch.io/jam/wasm4-v2)

Fly a spaceship around, shoot asteroids, collect StarShards, and play with friends over NETPLAY.

## Attention
This game contains visual effects, including **flashing colors** at **varying frequencies**, which may **trigger seizures** or other adverse reactions in individuals with **photosensitive epilepsy**. If you or anyone in your household has a history of epilepsy or seizures, please **be cautious while playing**. It is recommended to play in a **well-lit room** and to take regular breaks. **Stop playing and seek medical attention** if you experience symptoms such as: **dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitching, involuntary movements, loss of awareness, or convulsions**. By proceeding to play this game, you acknowledge and accept the potential risks associated with its visual effects.

## Controls
- **Using a gamepad is strongly recommended**
- Flight:
    - Pitch / Yaw  - **Arrows**
    - Speed / Roll - **X + Arrows**
- Weapons:
    - Laser - **Z**
    - Mine - **X + Z**
- WASM-4 Menu - **Enter**

## How To Play
- To **win** you must **collect** more **StarShard** than the opposing team. When an **asteroid is damaged** (shot with **laser**, or **crashed** into by a ship or another asteroid) it may drop a StarShard. Moving near it will **store it in your ship**. When you get **near** your **teams space station**, it will transfer and **count towards your score**.
- You can **practice** the game by starting it **single player**, but to really play the game **you will need a friend or three** to join you over **WASM-4's NETPLAY**. Press "**Enter**" then select "**COPY NETPLAY URL**" and **send your friend(s) the link**.
- The game can be played on **lower power devices** if the starting **asteroid count** is set **low enough**, if the game is **lagging** try **turning down "# Asteroids."**
- **Mines** can be **purchased** when **near your base**. You can **place a mine** behind your ship (good for if you are being pursued). The mine will **activate** once there are **no ships** in its damage radius. If anyone **gets too close** it will **explode** everything near it.
- Your ship will **heal** when near your team's **space station**, the **shield** heals **fast**, the **rest of your ship** much **slower**.
