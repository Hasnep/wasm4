# Mazethingie
This is the WASM-4 version of my Mazethingie game which is a maze generator / game. I Initially developed this for learning how to generate mazes for the levels in Waternet. 

## Controls

| Key        | Action                                           |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Up/Down    | Select menu, move player                         |
| Left/Right | Select mazewidth / height, move player           |
| X          | Confirm in menu, generate new maze while playing |
| Z          | Back to titlescreen                              |

## Aim of the game
You are the little red box, always starting in the lower right corner of the maze and you need to try and reach the top left exit of the mazes you generated.
