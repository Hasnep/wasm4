# Inspiration & Goals

Snake is a simple game. You can implement it in pretty much any language or engine. It also allows for real-time user interaction and is a challenging game in itself.

## Goals

At the end of the tutorial, you will have a working version of the game Snake.  
You can expand on it and make your very own version along the way.

During this tutorial you will learn how to ...

- ... change the color palette
- ... pick a color to draw
- ... draw primitives (rectangles)
- ... convert a sprite-image to source and draw it
- ... handle user input
- ... publish your game

## Code for the game

If you're stuck, check out [the source code](https://github.com/christopher-kleine/wasm-4-tutorial-games).
You'll find all completed implementations in the various languages.
